    On September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States killed nearly 3,000 people and injured more than 6,000 others. The attacks, which targeted the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., were carried out by al-Qaeda, a radical Islamist terrorist group.

  <p>
    In the aftermath of the attacks, the U.S. launched a global War on Terror and invaded Afghanistan to target al-Qaeda and the Taliban, who had harbored the group. The 9/11 attacks have had lasting impacts on global politics, international relations, and the lives of those directly affected by the tragedy.

  <p>
    Today, we remember and honor the victims of the 9/11 attacks and their families, and we reaffirm our commitment to preventing future acts of terrorism.
